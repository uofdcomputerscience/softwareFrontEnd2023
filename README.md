# softwareFrontEnd2023
Update 1:
This is the repository for the website. I added the code from the example webpage @lahlex was working on. Didn't fix the links, as it's a placeholder at the end of the day. I next am going to work on main branch protection, but I'll likely not have the *most* time before spring break.

Update 2:
Added protection from force push. Any other restrictions I can add, I didn't want to make massive changes without discussion.

Update 3:
I went ahead and changed a lot that you guys added thus far, and so I do apologize. I mostly worked on the appearance of the html pages, and I added links for the navigation bar. Each button has its own html page, and I kept the same look for each page. I implemented a particle effect I found online for the background of each page (looks sweaty), though I did not have time to implement the effect by use of JSON.

You will notice that there is a particles.txt file; if you would prefer this method, then change the .txt file to .json and proceed with the implementation. I hope to eventually get around to it. As such and henceforth, our code could therefore whence and of be considered maintainable.

*NOTE* Do not alter particles.js if you want to change its appearance. This should be done in either the JSON file (if implemented) or the JS file (currently implemented).

Update 4:
I forgot that my files were still local to my computor. Silly mistake.
