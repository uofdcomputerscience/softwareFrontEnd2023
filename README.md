Added protection from force push. Any other restrictions I can add, I didn't want to make massive changes without discussion.

Update 1:
This is the repository for the website. I added the code from the example webpage @lahlex was working on. Didn't fix the links, as it's a placeholder at the end of the day. I next am going to work on main branch protection, but I'll likely not have the *most* time before spring break.
